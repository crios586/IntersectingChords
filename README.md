# IntersectingChords

- Description: A simple program to estimate the probabilty that chord_AB & chord_CD intersect, given that points A,B,C,D are unique and randomly selected integers [0:360) along a circle
- Premise: chord_AB and chord_CD only intersect when point C or D (but not both) exist within chord_AB
- Result: after 1 million iteration, about 1/3 of them resulted in chord_AB and chord_CD intersecting
